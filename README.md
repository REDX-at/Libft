# Libft - 1337 (42 Network)
Libft is a fundamental project at 1337 (42 Network), where students create their own standard C library. This project is designed to help students solidify their understanding of core C functions by implementing them from scratch, while adhering to memory management best practices.

## Introduction
The Libft project serves as a foundation for many other projects at 1337, as students are required to reimplement basic C functions such as those found in <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, and other standard libraries. By building your own library, you gain a deeper understanding of how these functions work behind the scenes.

## Learning Path
1. String Manipulation Functions
Start by implementing functions like ft_strlen, ft_strcpy, ft_strncmp, and more. These functions provide a solid foundation for manipulating and analyzing C strings efficiently.

### 2. Memory Management Functions
Learn how to allocate, reallocate, and free memory dynamically with functions like ft_memset, ft_memcpy, ft_memmove, and ft_calloc. These functions are essential for managing resources effectively.

### 3. Linked Lists
Create functions for managing linked lists, such as ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd, and ft_lstiter, to work with dynamic data structures. This helps build a strong understanding of how memory and pointers work in C.

### 4. Character Checks and Conversions
Implement utility functions such as ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_toupper, and ft_tolower to perform character checks and conversions. These functions are often used in text processing.

### 5. Additional Custom Functions
Extend the library by adding custom functions that aren't part of the standard library, providing functionality that may be useful in other projects.

### Features
Custom C Library: A reimplementation of key functions from the standard C library.
String and Memory Utilities: Functions for string manipulation, memory management, and character checks.
Linked List Management: Functions to handle linked lists, allowing dynamic data handling.
Memory-Efficient: Careful management of resources to prevent memory leaks and ensure optimized performance.
